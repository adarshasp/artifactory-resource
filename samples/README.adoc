== Sample Pipeline

To run the sample pipeline using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

=== Install Docker compose
Follow https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[these instructions] to install Docker Compose if you've not already done so in the past.

=== Start Concouse CI and Artifactory
From this directory, run:

----
$ docker-compose up
----

This should start containers for Concourse and Artifactory.
You should find that Concourse is running at http://127.0.0.1:8080[127.0.0.1:8080] and Artifactory at http://127.0.0.1:8081/artifactory[127.0.0.1:8081/artifactory].

=== Deploy the sample pipeline
To deploy the sample pipeline first http://127.0.0.1:8080[download and install fly] then run the following:

----
$ fly --target sample login --concourse-url http://127.0.0.1:8080 -u admin -p admin
$ fly --target sample sync
----

You should now be able to deploy the pipeline with:

----
$ fly --target sample set-pipeline -p sample -c simple/pipeline.yml -l params.yml
----

If you go back to http://127.0.0.1:8080[127.0.0.1:8080] and login with `admin`/`admin` you should see the pipeline.

=== Unpause and trigger the job
The newly deployed pipeline will be paused, so you'll either need to unpause it from the web UI or run:

----
$ fly --target sample unpause-pipeline -p sample
----

When the pipeline is active, you can manually trigger the `build` job.

----
$ fly --target sample trigger-job -j sample/build
----

=== Inspect Artifactory
Once the job has finished you can http://127.0.0.1:8081/artifactory[go back to Artifactory] and login with `admin`/`password`.
Click on the "builds" tab and you should see the build that just ran.
You can also browse the `example-repo-local` repository to see the deployed jar file.
